A collection of my publicly available projects ranging from individual functions to modules, libraries and even entire games.

Project marked with an _asterisk*_ are written in Lua and require [Corona](https://coronalabs.com/) in order to work out of the box. If you are using Lua based engine/tool, like LÃ¶ve, then you will need to edit some parts of these projects to get them to work.

### List of projects

All projects within this repository are released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE). You don't need to provide me with credits or anything like that for using any of these projects, but as a fellow game developer, I would be happy to hear if my projects are actually helping others.
