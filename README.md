A collection of my publicly available projects ranging from individual functions to modules, libraries and even entire games.

Project marked with an _asterisk*_ are written in Lua and require [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) in order to work out of the box. If you are using some other Lua based engine/tool, like Defold or LÃ¶ve, then you will need to edit some parts of these projects to get them to work.

### List of projects

#### autotile*
autotile is a light-weight and fast module that uses bitwise tile index to automatically place correct tiles on a map. Uses Blob tileset (47 tile tileset). The project has a simple UI and comes with a tileset template.

#### screen*
A simple table containing fully dynamic coordinate and related values for displays of any size and aspect ratio to simplify creating and managing UI.

#### Pseudorandom Number Generator
Pseudorandom number generation using the linear congruential method. This module is intended to be used for when you need to generate platform independent pseudorandom numbers in your Lua applications.

#### Speed Test* (A fully functional game made with Solar2D in less than 150 lines of code.)
A simple speed tester game with flashing lights where the goal is to keep tapping the lights in the correct sequence for as long as possible. Features simple graphics, visual effects and score tracking.

#### Runners* (A fully functional game made with Solar2D in less than 100 lines of code.)
A game where the goal is to keep the runners from escaping by reaching the bottom of the screen. Features simple graphics, animations and score tracking.

#### Dodger* (A fully functional game made with Solar2D in less than 50 lines of code.)
A game with minimal vector art where the goal is to keep the ball afloat for as long as possible without hitting the moving platforms.

#### Collision filters
A simple convenience spreadsheet for creating custom collision filters in a quick and easy manner. Just tick the boxes, optionally name your collision filters and the rest is done automatically, so you just need to copy the filters to your projects.

### Closing remarks
All projects within this repository are released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE). You don't need to provide me with credits or anything like that for using any of these projects, but as a fellow game developer, I would be happy to hear if my projects are actually helping others. So, feel free to drop by the [Solar2D forums](https://forums.solar2d.com/) to say hi, send me an email or reach out to me via some other means!
