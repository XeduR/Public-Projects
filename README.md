# Solar2D (and Lua) Projects
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE)

A collection of my publicly available **Lua projects** ranging from individual functions to modules, libraries and even entire games.

Some of these projects, such as all of the games, are written using [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/). This means that if you want to use them with other Lua based engines, like with Defold, LÃ¶ve2D or Gideros, then you will need to edit some parts of these projects to get them to work.

## Closing remarks
All projects within this repository are released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE). You don't need to provide me with credits or anything like that for using any of these projects, but as a fellow game developer, I would be happy to hear if my projects are actually helping others. So, feel free to drop by the [Solar2D forums](https://forums.solar2d.com/) or join the [Solar2D Discord](https://discord.gg/QTD4g4w) to say hi, send me an email or reach out to me via some other means!
