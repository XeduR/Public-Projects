A collection of my publicly available projects ranging from individual functions to modules, libraries and even entire games.

### List of projects

#### autotile
autotile is a light-weight and fast module that uses bitwise tile index to automatically place correct tiles on a map. Uses Blob tileset (47 tile tileset). The project has a simple UI and comes with a tileset template.

### Closing remarks
As this module is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE), you don't need to provide me with credits or anything like that for using this module, but as a fellow Corona developer, I would be happy to hear if my projects are actually helping others. So, feel free to drop by the Corona forums to say hi or send me an email!
