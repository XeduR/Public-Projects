These are the source files for images, etc. that were created during Ludum Dare 46 game jam.

This folder, as well as the Git files in the root folder, are excluded from the build.
This means that if you build the project yourself using Solar2D, then you won't need
to worry about any of the files inside this folder. See build.settings file.
