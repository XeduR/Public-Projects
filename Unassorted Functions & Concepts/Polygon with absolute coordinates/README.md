You can find more of my personal projects over at my code portfolio site: [www.xedur.com](https://www.xedur.com). I work on all sorts of interesting projects, as well as plugins for Solar2D, in my free time. If you like what I'm doing and wish to support me, then [consider buying me a cup of coffee over at Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/xedur).
