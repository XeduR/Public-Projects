# Unassorted Functions & Concepts
[![License: MIT](http://xedur.com/img/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/XeduR/Public-Projects/blob/master/LICENSE)

This folder contains a all sorts of unassorted functions and concepts that address some specific question or problem.

I wrote some of these functions/concepts out of personal curiosity and others as answers to other people over at [https://forums.solar2d.com/](https://forums.solar2d.com/). In any case, I thought that these unassorted functions and concepts were worth saving, so I stored them here.

You can find more of my personal projects over at my code portfolio site: [www.xedur.com](https://www.xedur.com). I work on all sorts of interesting projects, as well as plugins for Solar2D, in my free time. If you like what I'm doing and wish to support me, then [consider buying me a cup of coffee over at Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/xedur).
