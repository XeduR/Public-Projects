# Closing thoughts
Last year I gave two lectures, went on a date with my then girlfriend, slep in the next day and then "quickly" helped my friend move, which pushed my previous entry, the funny albeit completely half-way done "Get A Job, Baby!" to become a JAM entry. This time I managed to create everything within 48 hours and all the source code and other files are found in this repository.

I still didn't plan ahead as well as I should have and I know that there's one bug in the The Dark concerning chopping down nearby trees and sometimes refueling the lantern doesn't go as expected.

With all that said, I am still proud that I managed to scrape together The Dark within the time limit, even if it lacked many of the features and visual polish I had planned. I guess it is time to try again harder next time!
